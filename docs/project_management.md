## Releases

Releases are iterative and depend heavily on community participation. The more active the community, the faster the releases. We encourage everyone to get involved and contribute to expedite the release cycles.

Understanding when a particular feature/bug is fixed/released:

For every filed GitHub issue that a contributor is actively working on, there will be release tags marked with it. This will indicate when it is expected to be released. It's not a guarantee, but it provides a predictability aspect.
